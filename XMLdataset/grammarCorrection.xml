is considered the least important topic in many parts of India .</t></pair><pair id="5" value=""><t>Imagine that you work in a factory and do just one thing , like put tires on cars ; if they fire you , they will destroy you because you do n't know how to do anything but put tires on cars .</t></pair><pair id="6" value=""><t>They draw in consumers like me , who purchase this great product with all these amazing ingredients , but sometimes they just make things up to increase their sales .</t></pair><pair id="7" value=""><t>I want to talk about harmful or bad products like alcohol , hair spray and cigarettes .</t></pair><pair id="8" value=""><t>For example , they can play football whenever they want but the others can not .</t></pair><pair id="9" value=""><t>Diana Krall is wearing a Rolex

everything involved in publicity affects the emotions of people around the world , encouraging them to buy anything they can .</t></pair><pair id="12" value=""><t>Since most urban areas are congested with cars , they all face the terrible problem of air and noise pollution .</t></pair><pair id="13" value=""><t>It is true that consumers prefer to buy a product that has a lower price , but when international companies that already have the certification begin to send it to market , people will prefer to buy theirs because the difference between prices is probably not going to affect them too much .</t></pair><pair id="14" value=""><t>Point four is that they have a big chance to prepare for their future life .</t></pair><pair id="15" value=""><t>If one person does not have good health , that means they could lose so many things .</t></pair><pair id="16" value=""><t>Many studies over the last 5 0 years have shown that people who have fluoride in their drinking water are considerably have less cavities than people who have not drinking nonfluoridated water .</t></pair><pair id="17" value=""><t>Likewise , the theory generated from the concept of memory is also not appropriate due to limited memory .</t></pair><pair id="18" value=""><t>They spent time on unmeaningful subjects .</t></pair><pair id="19" value=""><t>I was very fast ; my best time was 5 5 seconds for 4 0 0 hundred meters , and that is a good time in or out of this country .</t></pair><pair id="20" value=""><t>And young people spend more time on their lifestyle .</t></pair><pair id="21" value=""><t>In this society , those who do not study will never have opportunities or understand ideas that are important in these situations ; I am very interested and prefer study materials .</t></pair><pair id="22" value=""><t>We have to know this problem is serious but most people do n't know about this .</t></pair><pair id="23" value=""><t>Students can focus on only a few subjects they are interested in and they will become experts in those areas .</t></pair><pair id="24" value=""><t>But in other ways this makes the other country need to pay extra money to make , repair the roads What they did is reduce the amount of gas consumers , raise the gas tax , and low the income tax because they thought , only raising the gas tax is unfair .</t></pair><pair id="25" value=""><t>Today , MBA students with a background in engineering are in high demand .</t></pair><pair id="26" value=""><t>In the case of young people , the best way to get better grades and thus have a chance to find better jobs in the future is to study as hard as possible .</t></pair><pair id="27" value=""><t>So the school tried teaching the students a bit about every science that exists .</t></pair><pair id="28" value=""><t>I think they have to put skill into it .</t></pair><pair id="29" value=""><t>Specializing in one particular subject does not suit life in this era -- which is characterized by diversity and innovation .</t></pair><pair id="30" value=""><t>I will explain my points of view in the following paragraphs .</t></pair><pair id="31" value=""><t>He thinks differently than other people and he succeeded .</t></pair><pair id="32" value=""><t>These activities make the community a better place to live in and inculcate these values in all the members .</t></pair><pair id="33" value=""><t>Because all that broad knowledge helps them to understand their majors in university and also helps them to make the correct choice in specialized study .</t></pair><pair id="34" value=""><t>And it was very easy for me to understand why he always brought bad marks home .</t></pair><pair id="35" value=""><t>Then when we went to the Science Olympiad , she had diverse knowledge about the subjects as it was not unusual for her to think about new things .</t></pair><pair id="36" value=""><t>If every person seeks to learn and understand many scientific subjects , and anyone can or ca n't do it , then the result will be that science wo n't improve .</t></pair><pair id="37" value=""><t>Thus , in concordance with the above , I agree wholeheartedly that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .</t></pair><pair id="38" value=""><t>Third , they put it in front of the door of the store so that people will see it even if it is no good .</t></pair><pair id="39" value=""><t>However , are all these things good for people ?</t></pair><pair id="40" value=""><t>Soon they will run out , based on the current rate of utilization .</t></pair><pair id="41" value=""><t>In the lecture , however , the professor opposed the statement in the reading .</t></pair><pair id="42" value=""><t>But YOU have to create these opportunities .</t></pair><pair id="43" value=""><t>Throughout our lives , we need to talk about our families .</t></pair><pair id="44" value=""><t>They try new things .</t></pair><pair id="45" value=""><t>In order to do this , they would need to learn additional skills , either theoretical or practical , that would increase their understanding and future application of their chosen subject .</t></pair><pair id="46" value=""><t>If you want to sell a product , you must create a beautiful image around it .</t></pair><pair id="47" value=""><t>Second , the place that is being filmed must be very clear and the chin must be relaxed , etc .</t></pair><pair id="48" value=""><t>And will put your mind on a non-stop learning ...</t></pair><pair id="49" value=""><t>This will be the proof of speeding offense so that the police can easily catch them .</t></pair><pair id="50" value=""><t>Today , computer skills are the most important life skill .</t></pair><pair id="51" value=""><t>He at last chose to learn the truth .</t></pair><pair id="52" value=""><t>I have never stopped to think about this , but this is a real possibility for the future .</t></pair><pair id="53" value=""><t>Young has his own field and works hard to do more benefit to the society .</t></pair><pair id="54" value=""><t>And about the new information there are editors .</t></pair><pair id="55" value=""><t>If we consider an idea as a totally autonomous concept within the individual process of defining reality , I believe that ideas are useless , because they are not based on experience .</t></pair><pair id="56" value=""><t>He/she wants to know everything about the universe , God , death , etc. ; these are concepts that encourage a lot of ideas , but the facts have not been found yet .</t></pair><pair id="57" value=""><t>It is so expensive that it is the only thing those people can do besides their daily living .</t></pair><pair id="58" value=""><t>They make very high profits year after year and their numbers also increase year after year .</t></pair><pair id="59" value=""><t>For this reason , the number of cars will decrease in the future .</t></pair><pair id="60" value=""><t>So he took it upon himself to narrow his research to a subject which was a mystery to the world .</t></pair><pair id="61" value=""><t>Others who do n't understand this concept will sell uncertified wood .</t></pair><pair id="62" value=""><t>I did n't have self-confidence .</t></pair><pair id="63" value=""><t>If there are specialized doctors , it means that the doctor has done the operation many times before and is very talented at his job .</t></pair><pair id="64" value=""><t>So it will be a good situation .</t></pair><pair id="65" value=""><t>Also , I have traveled in a group without a tour guide .</t></pair><pair id="66" value=""><t>The school teachers they 're the ones who take the future young generations so we have to support them to make younger ones more knowledgeable .</t></pair><pair id="67" value=""><t>So this test is very important to them .</t></pair><pair id="68" value=""><t>But most of the time it is important because most student do not do badly and their thoughts and ideas are very important .</t></pair><pair id="69" value=""><t>Otherwise , it will be a problem for us to understand certain things in life .</t></pair><pair id="70" value=""><t>I personally like to participate in all kinds of activities and meet many people like to as well .</t></pair><pair id="71" value=""><t>Second , the number of treasure locations are implausibly large .</t></pair><pair id="72" value=""><t>He mainly concentrated on the questions that he was asked at the time of the interview .</t></pair><pair id="73" value=""><t>First , when we learn about some subjects we should have more information about what we study , and students will get information more easily and proficiently .</t></pair><pair id="74" value=""><t>In a market economy the price must reflect the cost of the product and the consumer 's willingness to buy it .</t></pair><pair id="75" value=""><t>Some tour guides will want to ensure maximum security , which will make the tour difficult because you will only have a wonderful view through a bus window .</t></pair><pair id="76" value=""><t>Because the fashion culture has changed .</t></pair><pair id="77" value=""><t>Actually , that was an unstable trip .</t></pair><pair id="78" value=""><t>It is obvious that after returning I was tired and the night is meant for sleeping ! .</t></pair><pair id="79" value=""><t>Nowadays , we need a person who is capable of all sorts of works .</t></pair><pair id="80" value=""><t>Finally , fish farming is related to long term wastefulness which can pollute the sea .</t></pair><pair id="81" value=""><t>Establishing connections with other researchers will open the door for new collaborative projects .</t></pair><pair id="82" value=""><t>Now I have outstanding scores .</t></pair><pair id="83" value=""><t>He knows that his help to others will go unreturned .</t></pair><pair id="84" value=""><t>Furthermore , my nineteen-year-old friends drive their own cars , and they would always like to buy another one .</t></pair><pair id="85" value=""><t>As the cities were smaller , there was less violence , noise , traffic ...</t></pair><pair id="86" value=""><t>There can be no bothering and no hassle .</t></pair><pair id="87" value=""><t>Even though he knows the advertisement is unrealistic and looks too pretty , he is going to buy the product .</t></pair><pair id="88" value=""><t>These are several opposing viewpoints I observed between the lecture and the passage .</t></pair><pair id="89" value=""><t>Even though she does not have job , she also needs a car to use to pick up her kids or go shopping .</t></pair><pair id="90" value=""><t>Early in the industry , many of the workers worked together .</t></pair><pair id="91" value=""><t>Asasazi were kept from living in the American Southwest by very high temperatures , which often caused droughts .</t></pair><pair id="92" value=""><t>I have several reasons that support my choice .</t></pair><pair id="93" value=""><t>Because if one time you are successful , then the next time -- well , why not ?</t></pair><pair id="94" value=""><t>While at University , he might specialize in a subject , while still taking a number of diverse other courses .</t></pair><pair id="95" value=""><t>Now we have information all around us .</t></pair><pair id="96" value=""><t>Both of these men have dealt with situations in an unconventional manner and the results are for everyone to see .</t></pair><pair id="97" value=""><t>This shall affect the exams .</t></pair><pair id="98" value=""><t>Moreover , taking risks teaches you to accept both winning and losing , and that is the most important lesson one can learn to achieve any kind of objective .</t></pair><pair id="99" value=""><t>I would like to be the one to initiate whatever I do on my trip to get the most out of my trip .</t></pair><pair id="100" value=""><t>However , one student pointed out my mistakes .</t></pair><pair id="101" value=""><t>It 's normal : proposing something to the client and constructing something differently is the best way ( and it 's legal ! ) .</t></pair><pair id="102" value=""><t>This is how we are transforming our society in present days. The actual fact of being against this statement is that we are looking at what we want at the moment , in order to have a great time .</t></pair><pair id="103" value=""><t>Not only this , but without a clear understanding of what is being taught , the student would not be able to perform well on the tests .</t></pair><pair id="104" value=""><t>For example , if a man 's hobby is playing football , he must want to play from day to night and from night to day .</t></pair><pair id="105" value=""><t>At least I do in my consulting job .</t></pair><pair id="106" value=""><t>Although a few lucky ones struck gold , most people simply vanished when they left their homes , only to be forgotten , while others developed an obsession for the western mirage .</t></pair><pair id="107" value=""><t>And like the citizens of developed countries , these people want to own cars themselves .</t></pair><pair id="108" value=""><t>We grasp many subjects and get ample exposure greatly and easily .</t></pair><pair id="109" value=""><t>But on the other hand , there are also people that are often convinced by the interesting advertisements they see everywhere , and because of this they often face problems with the products they buy and many times there is no way to return that product .</t></pair><pair id="110" value=""><t>They take responsibility for the future of their society and the results ; it can be the most helpful thing for society .</t></pair><pair id="111" value=""><t>So the conclusion is clear .</t></pair><pair id="112" value=""><t>And you can change your views and ideas but you cannot change the facts .</t></pair><pair id="113" value=""><t>An older person has to give way to a younger one no matter whether he likes it or not .</t></pair><pair id="114" value=""><t>Ever increasing competency rates force them into frequent business model changes for compatible transitional flexibility .</t></pair><pair id="115" value=""><t>However , this book passage casts doubt on the speaker 's words .</t></pair><pair id="116" value=""><t>However , all of them are limited .</t></pair><pair id="117" value=""><t>That is what it gives us ; a lot of opportunity to think .</t></pair><pair id="118" value=""><t>The placebo effect is not an illusion but real , so the drug was affected by the placebo effect .</t></pair><pair id="119" value=""><t>When I go to travel to see something I want to see , we do not know when it is opened or closed even though I 'll study beforehand , and so it might suddenly be closed .</t></pair><pair id="120" value=""><t>It costs half of the other but its lifecycle is the same .</t></pair><pair id="121" value=""><t>What we do now , we will be able to do later .</t></pair><pair id="122" value=""><t>According to me , there are two kind of studies : the highly technical ones and the others .</t></pair><pair id="123" value=""><t>Thus , we begin to share information and ask about our own weaker subject .</t></pair><pair id="124" value=""><t>For example , in the 2 0 0 6 World Cup in Germany , many coaches wanted teamwork .</t></pair><pair id="125" value=""><t>Many scientists obtained clear results from the investigations after the facts were on the table but before they even began to theorize about them .</t></pair><pair id="126" value=""><t>This will give rise to a holistic understanding .</t></pair><pair id="127" value=""><t>They want people to understand that the product is the best and you can really trust it .</t></pair><pair id="128" value=""><t>There are many theories about the reasons for migrating and the methods of migrating .</t></pair><pair id="129" value=""><t>Thus , the environmental issue will push more people to consider other ways to commute , rather than driving a car .</t></pair><pair id="130" value=""><t>On the other hand , he/she can continue doing what they do well and hope to be noticed .</t></pair><pair id="131" value=""><t>Video is convenient , but for teachers concerned about their students , the use of textbooks provides students with good abilities .</t></pair><pair id="132" value=""><t>They tend to restrict traffic on certain days and between certain hours and increase parking fees , etc .</t></pair><pair id="133" value=""><t>For instance , we may consider that evolution exists .</t></pair><pair id="134" value=""><t>So depending on the study , one way might be better than the other ; the important thing is to choose the right one .</t></pair><pair id="135" value=""><t>I am really sorry to continue like this , but right now I am taking the test in a room with five other people and we are all taking the test on a computer .</t></pair><pair id="136" value=""><t>In my opinion , it is dependent on a particular person .</t></pair><pair id="137" value=""><t>Many people are killed by cars .</t></pair><pair id="138" value=""><t>Global warming and the greenhouse effect have started recently .</t></pair><pair id="139" value=""><t>For example , if the good , skilled people do something wrong , they do not respond like a thief , robber , or criminal and make problems for other people .</t></pair><pair id="140" value=""><t>For example , when we talk about speed , they must understand why it is dangerous ; it is better than learning after they have an accident .</t></pair><pair id="141" value=""><t>Therefore , people will be able to live with the automobile society and the nature for the future .</t></pair><pair id="142" value=""><t>Then what if the speaker explains the project erroneously ?</t></pair><pair id="143" value=""><t>Each car should be occupied by three people , and it is hoped that this will lessen the number of cars driven during rush hour .</t></pair><pair id="144" value=""><t>And they can make products and sell them cheaper than most countries .</t></pair><pair id="145" value=""><t>Marco Polo spoke the Persian language , not Chinese or Mongolian .</t></pair><pair id="146" value=""><t>That is because of their knowledge on many subjects .</t></pair><pair id="147" value=""><t>The fish industry affects these animals because these companies used the fish to create different foods , like oil .</t></pair><pair id="148" value=""><t>Therefore , I bought a car immediately .</t></pair><pair id="149" value=""><t>Although weather-related factors could be considered , such as the landscape of the area .</t></pair><pair id="150" value=""><t>One of the reasons that fish is important is that it can be an important buoy for livestock and poultry .</t></pair><pair id="151" value=""><t>One the policy mentioned in the reading passage .</t></pair><pair id="152" value=""><t>Such unwritten law is furious , but our world is furious .</t></pair><pair id="153" value=""><t>Also , youth have less mental pressure .</t></pair><pair id="154" value=""><t>Think about creating a fire break .</t></pair><pair id="155" value=""><t>Finally , the third reason is that that birds use a type of internal compass ; birds have crystals of the mineral magnetite embedded in their beaks .</t></pair><pair id="156" value=""><t>If the teacher taught them , they will know to study it .</t></pair><pair id="157" value=""><t>Just search the internet and we will find what we want , no matter how many books stimulate our imagination or how high quality the book is .</t></pair><pair id="158" value=""><t>In one case , for example , the copper scroll merely notes that treasure is hidden in the vicinity of a certain river .</t></pair><pair id="159" value=""><t>In this case students learn a concept that ispossible to use in other fields .</t></pair><pair id="160" value=""><t>This is the cheapest way for people to take a trip .</t></pair><pair id="161" value=""><t>According to the lecture , it is more important to provide enough fish to people .</t></pair><pair id="162" value=""><t>Futhermore , a tour guide will also provide safety and security for the travelers , since they already know the do 's and don'ts about the tour .</t></pair><pair id="163" value=""><t>On the other hand , each academic field needs specialists in order to progress .</t></pair><pair id="164" value=""><t>Which caused her situation to get worse .</t></pair><pair id="165" value=""><t>For example , one man is a football team fan .</t></pair><pair id="166" value=""><t>By using new things , which is usually uncommon for them , it includes risk with it .</t></pair><pair id="167" value=""><t>You can see that in many books , the news , newspapers , TVs and computers .</t></pair><pair id="168" value=""><t>When people are very young , they must have time to gain knowledge ; they do not have much time to enjoy life as much as possible .</t></pair><pair id="169" value=""><t>This argument is not only true now , it has been for ages ; I want to talk about a live example , Sir .</t></pair><pair id="170" value=""><t>Lastly , they have to study a disease , which means they will be saved .</t></pair><pair id="171" value=""><t>The consumers also know what advertisements are like .</t></pair><pair id="172" value=""><t>Learn !</t></pair><pair id="173" value=""><t>There are very successful politicians who never tried anything new .</t></pair><pair id="174" value=""><t>You can become smarter than other people .</t></pair><pair id="175" value=""><t>In my opinion , this statement is groundless and the youngsters today do contribute to their communities to a great extent .</t></pair><pair id="176" value=""><t>And now , because of this man , I am writing my essay on the computer .</t></pair><pair id="177" value=""><t>Therefore , we have to reduce sulfur and nitrogen dioxide .</t></pair><pair id="178" value=""><t>Most of the things I hear are not true .</t></pair><pair id="179" value=""><t>I think it 's very hard to make the point and have everyone understand because when a few started to do so , they thought it was not fair at all ; they are the few who are suffering , other people cannot get it and continue doing the same thing and it just makes those people think stupidly .</t></pair><pair id="180" value=""><t>Maybe in the beginning , but after some time other animals in the environment will choose them as their new food .</t></pair><pair id="181" value=""><t>The older man would prefer to enjoy all the time he has ; remembering that we only live once .</t></pair><pair id="182" value=""><t>The scraping will create heat and that heat ( energy ) will go in the car .</t></pair><pair id="183" value=""><t>You will face enormous difficulties in life if you do n't know at least something about every subject .</t></pair><pair id="184" value=""><t>Younger generations are more adaptable ; thus they can adapt to changing technology .</t></pair><pair id="185" value=""><t>That is why I 'm here , ready for my education ; that is , to specialize in one specific subject that I would like to learn about in detail .</t></pair><pair id="186" value=""><t>Furthermore , the professor denies reading the passage stating that treasure does not exist and is just fiction .</t></pair><pair id="187" value=""><t>I chose law and began to study everything about Italian law .</t></pair><pair id="188" value=""><t>But ideas on how you can solve this problem will actually give you a solution to the problem .</t></pair><pair id="189" value=""><t>After all , I am now personally trying to go on a diet and manage my health condition more carefully .</t></pair><pair id="190" value=""><t>Knowledge also plays an important role in life , and can be acquired by understanding concepts rather than just learning things .</t></pair><pair id="191" value=""><t>Most people do n't care about the environment or how cars greatly affect the ozone layer .</t></pair><pair id="192" value=""><t>In addition , it has a negative influence on agriculture .</t></pair><pair id="193" value=""><t>Also , they have more responsibilities than young people .</t></pair><pair id="194" value=""><t>The professor said , " This can be changed to a different environment .

most effective way to decrease the use of gas for three reasons .</t></pair><pair id="419" value=""><t>Next , kids are more attracted to advertisements .</t></pair><pair id="420" value=""><t>Successful people will explain any other matter and discuss any problem .</t></pair><pair id="421" value=""><t>But it is dangerous because some drivers make trouble with other drivers and then when some driver crashes their car , the streets become busy .</t></pair><pair id="422" value=""><t>Nobody can create a problem with this type of literature because it is already fixed data .</t></pair><pair id="423" value=""><t>Also , the professor indicated we should be careful when using prescribed fire as a solution .</t></pair><pair id="424" value=""><t>If they can no longer pay the high prices , people will have to make a change and take the bus or train .</t></pair><pair id="425" value=""><t>This will reduce the pollution caused by the carbon from cars .</t></pair><pair id="426" value=""><t>Moreover , they will have to learn advanced course material .</t></pair><pair id="427" value=""><t>In my view , age is sometimes a barrier to do some things in life .</t></pair><pair id="428" value=""><t>To put it simply , they said they lost their appeal .</t></pair><pair id="429" value=""><t>For example , nursing students study in a nursing college for three to four years .</t></pair><pair id="430" value=""><t>I believe that the product 's quality mentioned in the shops are exactly the same as mentioned in the advertisements .</t></pair><pair id="431" value=""><t>Then , define your goals and work hard to achieve them .</t></pair><pair id="432" value=""><t>Critics of this policy focus on three points ; first , Yellowstone fires scorched a large area of land , resulting in the loss of a lot of plant species .</t></pair><pair id="433" value=""><t>In my experience , there are some lectures which are completely based on facts , and the chance for me to apply them is rare .</t></pair><pair id="434" value=""><t>When you understand that ideas are one way that you can figure out about a statement , you appreciate these moments .</t></pair><pair id="435" value=""><t>However , there are lots of reasons that the placebo effect works .</t></pair><pair id="436" value=""><t>In today 's world , there is a deep and almost unreplenishable thirst for change .</t></pair><pair id="437" value=""><t>The kids can stay outside every day and play .</t></pair><pair id="438" value=""><t>First , I think that communities equal human relationship .</t></pair><pair id="439" value=""><t>It may also ruin your health .</t></pair><pair id="440" value=""><t>Water is needed for life .</t></pair><pair id="441" value=""><t>Like other people , I have seen many instances on TV where rich people are interested in politics , sports , new technologies , and space .</t></pair><pair id="442" value=""><t>As a result , studies in Britain have shown that fluoride can lead to more bone density , and therefore fewer bone fractures among the elderly .</t></pair><pair id="443" value=""><t>Sometimes people may also meet some new friends in the traveling group .</t></pair><pair id="444" value=""><t>If students just learn facts , they will soon forget them , but this will not happen as easily if they properly understand the concepts behind the facts .</t></pair><pair id="445" value=""><t>When I started completing my homework on time , I gradually improved .</t></pair><pair id="446" value=""><t>Because of studying in this way , of course , I will gain so much , and will gain a lot of knowledge from the book I study from .</t></pair><pair id="447" value=""><t>When you understand the concepts and ideas , it is up to you to prove them and to see if they are really what you have been told , and I think this is the main reason that students prefer facts rather than understanding ideas and concepts .</t></pair><pair id="448" value=""><t>For example , if you are attempting to study arts and sciences and attain qualifications in both , you are an extraordinary student .</t></pair><pair id="449" value=""><t>Therefore , as long as it is a country where I can understand their language , I will travel alone .</t></pair><pair id="450" value=""><t>The government will try to regulate air pollution .</t></pair><pair id="451" value=""><t>So in this field , it is very important to understand all concepts and ideas given to us and use them to solve problems .</t></pair><pair id="452" value=""><t>Because they sent out 2 0 % of the whole carbon emission , ?</t></pair><pair id="453" value=""><t>In my opinion , it is easier to understand one thing , by combining processes , than to remember many separate facts or dates .</t></pair><pair id="454" value=""><t>It is also about taking risks rather than only doing .</t></pair><pair id="455" value=""><t>No scientist would have ever come up with their wonderful inventions and the world would never have progressed .</t></pair><pair id="456" value=""><t>There will be a technological development in the future , but it will only promote the use of the public transportation system , not the car .</t></pair><pair id="457" value=""><t>Not being with a guide gives you the liberty to visit the places you want to visit at your own pace and the freedom to choose any place you want to go .</t></pair><pair id="458" value=""><t>Usually in advertisements a presentable face is used : models , babies , popular athletes , to try to make the product look appealing .</t></pair><pair id="459" value=""><t>Bungee jumping is not something that every young person wants to do , but even if he did want to do it , he probably would n't be able to .</t></pair><pair id="460" value=""><t>Close-up video clips of a juicy hamburger flying around the screen , surely satisfying the models eating it could easily create in the viewers a false sense of being hungry and urge them to hop into their car and drive to a fast food restaurant nearby to get what they have seen .</t></pair><pair id="461" value=""><t>So only time will tell what actually happens .</t></pair><pair id="462" value=""><t>As we are all aware , when we we 're out something unexpected could happen : like catching a disease , having an accident , or something else that is n't planned .</t></pair><pair id="463" value=""><t>Then , auto makers need to develop systems for almost complete safety .</t></pair><pair id="464" value=""><t>Third , the professor agrees that gas prices in the United States are cheap , and they should raise them to protect the enviroment and the health of people .</t></pair><pair id="465" value=""><t>Nowadays , there are many people who think they are the most important thing and that they only have to work for themselves .</t></pair><pair id="466" value=""><t>In general , there are many characters in a book .</t></pair><pair id="467" value=""><t>But they do things differently than others , which gives them success .</t></pair><pair id="468" value=""><t>People feel more secure and comfortable traveling in their own cars rather than taking several different forms of public transportation and reaching their destination late .</t></pair><pair id="469" value=""><t>The second critique of this method is that the costumer loses all critical reflex and then he is not on guard .</t></pair><pair id="470" value=""><t>As a result , it will be easier for you to learn many things .</t></pair><pair id="471" value=""><t>In short , these were critical parts that contradicted the reading materials .</t></pair><pair id="472" value=""><t>I think it 's harder for a successful person to risk something -- they could lose much more than others .</t></pair><pair id="473" value=""><t>We can also see what is happening in the world through accessing the Internet though a mobile phone .</t></pair><pair id="474" value=""><t>So the importance of communities in society decreased .</t></pair><pair id="475" value=""><t>I have found that successful people use their money and their ideas for a way to success .</t></pair><pair id="476" value=""><t>In my case , when I did a job interview , the employer asked me questions about common sense things like society , policy , art , and so on .</t></pair><pair id="477" value=""><t>At some point in time , they will have to face failures and a lot of struggles .</t></pair><pair id="478" value=""><t>Because it transmits the habitats from Eastern Europe to different parts of the world .</t></pair><pair id="479" value=""><t>Consider a family that goes shopping on a weekend .</t></pair><pair id="480" value=""><t>Another reason is that many people see some exotic cars as luxury cars and this encourages the industries .</t></pair><pair id="481" value=""><t>Now the market is occupied by lots of cars with varying extra options .</t></pair><pair id="482" value=""><t>It is also undeniable that if a man has diversified knowledge , it would be immediately useful .</t></pair><pair id="483" value=""><t>In my opinion , I think advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .</t></pair><pair id="484" value=""><t>So , some people use only cars for transportation .</t></pair><pair id="485" value=""><t>They have to think twice before performing even routine activities of life .</t></pair><pair id="486" value=""><t>Most of the actors , soldiers , workers , and students are young people .</t></pair><pair id="487" value=""><t>To respond adequately to the world we live in , we need to understand it first .</t></pair><pair id="488" value=""><t>In fact , even today most of these systems run on electricity , which can be harnessed in several non-polluting ways .</t></pair><pair id="489" value=""><t>Compared to older people , they do n't even have enough time to enjoy their lives .</t></pair><pair id="490" value=""><t>Also it has been on all the sections : we have to use the headphones because it makes a lot of noise and it is very hard to stay on task .</t></pair><pair id="491" value=""><t>They are clean and big and so on .</t></pair><pair id="492" value=""><t>Rolling stones gather no moss , says the proverb .</t></pair><pair id="493" value=""><t>It is difficult only to watch educational things .</t></pair><pair id="494" value=""><t>A lot of critics are concerned that the reqired testing is so long that it deceases the value for patients .</t></pair><pair id="495" value=""><t>I have a reason to study English .</t></pair><pair id="496" value=""><t>Buses should be reserved for spots where there is no possibility to set up tramway routes .</t></pair><pair id="497" value=""><t>I think that it is not always fair because not all students work in the same way and with the same responsibilities .</t></pair><pair id="498" value=""><t>Of course , things are new and very risky .</t></pair><pair id="499" value=""><t>For example , little children are told not to cross the street during a red light , because it is so dangerous to do so that we cannot let kids learn from accidents .</t></pair><pair id="500" value=""><t>In my opinion , students need to acquire knowledge .</t></pair><pair id="501" value=""><t>Since more people are able to buy cars , the demand for and production of cars will increase , and ultimately this means that the number of cars will increase over the next twenty years .</t></pair><pair id="502" value=""><t>First , because they have spent so much time on the computer , they do n't know how to communicate with someone in person .</t></pair><pair id="503" value=""><t>I believe that understanding concepts and ideas is a more important way of studying for students .</t></pair><pair id="504" value=""><t>I ordered them and was promised that they would be delivered to my house in a few days .</t></pair><pair id="505" value=""><t>We know that prescribed burning should be repreated every few years , but it 's very expensive to implement this schedule .</t></pair><pair id="506" value=""><t>The second difference between an encyclopedia and the Internet is that there a lot of viruses and hackers on the web , and one of them can easily change the information about any kind of topic .</t></pair><pair id="507" value=""><t>If I want to win a case in court in , for example , a case where technical questions are to be considered , it is not enough to know just about the law .</t></pair><pair id="508" value=""><t>Second , if there are any problems with the goods .</t></pair><pair id="509" value=""><t>Some people might say , " Hey , where does energy come from ? "</t></pair><pair id="510" value=""><t>Successful people try to do new things , like inventing a machine that can help people .</t></pair><pair id="511" value=""><t>However , the problem is , how long will it take us to find out that we are actually controlled by advertisements and the perfect image they have given us ?</t></pair><pair id="512" value=""><t>Comsumers are not likely to buy a pair of trousers when the claim is that they will increase their capacity to fly .</t></pair><pair id="513" value=""><t>Therefore , German students will have to work harder , think much more , and thus become even more skilled .</t></pair><pair id="514" value=""><t>One reason is that endangered animals are breaking nature .</t></pair><pair id="515" value=""><t>So , I think having self-confidence is more important than having knowledge .</t></pair><pair id="516" value=""><t>A young person , however , will need to time to define his or her wants in life .</t></pair><pair id="517" value=""><t>The work should be good , and not just meaningless .</t></pair><pair id="518" value=""><t>Natural disasters always bring damage to the economy .</t></pair><pair id="519" value=""><t>It is rightly said that life is not about adding years to life , but life to years .</t></pair><pair id="520" value=""><t>First , advertisements make me want to buy something unplanned .</t></pair><pair id="521" value=""><t>There are two major reasons : it benefits socialization and mental health .</t></pair><pair id="522" value=""><t>For these reasons , I need a high score on the TOEFL .</t></pair><pair id="523" value=""><t>I believe this number is increasing , and will continue to increase as generations of educated people pass on their wisdom to their children .</t></pair><pair id="524" value=""><t>In my opinion , the need for community service and volunteerism arises in the absence of adequate resources or when somebody is not fulfilling their responsibilities .</t></pair><pair id="525" value=""><t>After I consumed that drink , then I came to know that we should not believe the advertisements .</t></pair><pair id="526" value=""><t>But it is very different from the one in the passage .</t></pair><pair id="527" value=""><t>They just create such a good impression that people run out to buy them .</t></pair><pair id="528" value=""><t>Since I liked enough areas inside , I bought the car a few days later .</t></pair><pair id="529" value=""><t>Exactly like master of none and jack of all trades .</t></pair><pair id="530" value=""><t>The economy would benefit because this would enable it to have a worldwide competition with the car manufactures .</t></pair><pair id="531" value=""><t>He and I are good pals but we do n't want to get a lower score than each other .</t></pair><pair id="532" value=""><t>It is composed by not only senior but also University students .</t></pair><pair id="533" value=""><t>One of them is the long term wastefulness of the process .</t></pair><pair id="534" value=""><t>And if there is knowledge in all areas , then it provides an added advantage to your knowledge level .</t></pair><pair id="535" value=""><t>That is because If I became a member , I would be highly esteemed among my friends .</t></pair><pair id="536" value=""><t>The governments and the scientists are also promoting the less use of private cars as they are one of the greatest contributors to the air pollution .</t></pair><pair id="537" value=""><t>People use public water as drinking water .</t></pair><pair id="538" value=""><t>That will never cause the economic problem .</t></pair><pair id="539" value=""><t>Because this is not very easy to use .</t></pair><pair id="540" value=""><t>In my opinion , if you want be a successful person , you should be brave enough to try new things and take risks .</t></pair><pair id="541" value=""><t>On the other hand , scientists agree that the predators are beneficial in controlling the population of the menhaden .</t></pair><pair id="542" value=""><t>Do we consider her a smart girl ?</t></pair><pair id="543" value=""><t>For example , in a chemistry class , when you talk about the fact that oxygen is needed for the burning process , you can support your idea with the fact that a blanket over fire puts out the fire by cutting oxygen .</t></pair><pair id="544" value=""><t>Every beginning has its end .</t></pair><pair id="545" value=""><t>Who do we match together ?</t></pair><pair id="546" value=""><t>They explain the specific points using the examples about dinosaurs ' behavior and physical faces .</t></pair><pair id="547" value=""><t>The lecture mentions Mongol court records of the time .</t></pair><pair id="548" value=""><t>It is harmful for many other animals and it pollutes water sources .</t></pair><pair id="549" value=""><t>First , teachers find the right way to teach us , and every teacher gives students confidence .</t></pair><pair id="550" value=""><t>We do n't usually study these subjects very deeply .</t></pair><pair id="551" value=""><t>You often find people investing money in inventions only to sustain their own business .</t></pair><pair id="552" value=""><t>For instance , many people use airplanes , ships , and trains .</t></pair><pair id="553" value=""><t>As a former Law Teacher at the University of Belgrano , I have experienced the problems students face when taking their oral law examinations .</t></pair><pair id="554" value=""><t>The first reason is that students are very critical and always have many ideas based on their own opinions .</t></pair><pair id="555" value=""><t>They may go to the elderly person 's house and help them with eating meals or going for a walk .</t></pair><pair id="556" value=""><t>There are a lot of big streets in my town .</t></pair><pair id="557" value=""><t>The young pass the diseases to a couple of people and here are the young still enjoying life .</t></pair><pair id="558" value=""><t>It would be a really wasteful idea .</t></pair><pair id="559" value=""><t>For example , they can read again if they want , and back to the page that they can not understand or they are impressed .</t></pair><pair id="560" value=""><t>Tour guides are generally trained and certified by supervising entities , and are therefore expected to provide the best possible guidance to their customers .</t></pair><pair id="561" value=""><t>However , I still believe that learnng facts is important for students .</t></pair><pair id="562" value=""><t>whlie you will be help each other of work together after gratuation from university .</t></pair><pair id="563" value=""><t>He usually bring a books and asks someone questions ; he wants to understand the book .</t></pair><pair id="564" value=""><t>The operation room is not a bookmaker 's office or lottery house .</t></pair><pair id="565" value=""><t>This means that the more languages you know , the better you can get along in other countries .</t></pair><pair id="566" value=""><t>Recently scientists have been working on a new generation of lie detector that can perform brain-scanning to find out if a person is telling the truth .</t></pair><pair id="567" value=""><t>By keeping his focus on one industry and one subject , he ensures that he is up-to-date and fully aware of all the current happenings in the industry or subject .</t></pair><pair id="568" value=""><t>They had success and they had the power .</t></pair><pair id="569" value=""><t>It will be always puls things for them .</t></pair><pair id="570" value=""><t>There is going to be a huge market if the product is brand new , which means there is a big opportunity to make lots of money .</t></pair><pair id="571" value=""><t>Before , it was n't like that ; we were at all times under the control of the man and economically dependent on him .</t></pair><pair id="572" value=""><t>When you are a teenager , you start experiencing some sexual changes that change your way of thinking ; you start thinking more about the other gender than about toys , and enjoy going out with friends more than staying home to play with toys .</t></pair><pair id="573" value=""><t>This will help them to get good marks .</t></pair><pair id="574" value=""><t>By avoiding this , it will lead to a much purer and natural world for future generations to live in .</t></pair><pair id="575" value=""><t>In extreme cases , some even gain weight because of this .</t></pair><pair id="576" value=""><t>Firstly , some immigrant events happening in other countries or areas may happen in the place you live someday in the future .</t></pair><pair id="577" value=""><t>I feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars , it will make people keep riding cars .</t></pair><pair id="578" value=""><t>I do not want to go to the Eiffel Tower in Paris or The Statue of Liberty in New York when I travel , because they are too famous , so I already heard and saw about them .</t></pair><pair id="579" value=""><t>Others would like to spend more time shopping than going around places .</t></pair><pair id="580" value=""><t>I feel this will create jobs for people because all car companies will have to adjust to the change from gas to water fuel use .</t></pair><pair id="581" value=""><t>As a student who studies many different subjects at the same time , I found it very beneficial .</t></pair><pair id="582" value=""><t>So it is complex , and looking after many new employees every year can be difficult .</t></pair><pair id="583" value=""><t>In this case , the advertisement totally made an impact on that baby .</t></pair><pair id="584" value=""><t>Maybe they had enjoyed life when they were young , too .</t></pair><pair id="585" value=""><t>Lastly , business owners thought factories would help reduce their overall business expenses by reducing their transportation costs .</t></pair><pair id="586" value=""><t>When I say research , I mean I ask people that have used the product like friends or family , or I read forums on the Internet .</t></pair><pair id="587" value=""><t>As it is important to see your work in the context of the whole car , he now still benefits from his broadly chosen majors in college .</t></pair><pair id="588" value=""><t>Successful people have to do things in a stable way and do what they already know how to do well .</t></pair><pair id="589" value=""><t>The students must have improved to get the correct view of the grades .</t></pair><pair id="590" value=""><t>There is increasing population in every area .</t></pair><pair id="591" value=""><t>Firstly , the population of the world is increasing exponentially .</t></pair><pair id="592" value=""><t>This person guides you through paradise and takes you to wonderful places .</t></pair><pair id="593" value=""><t>Really successful people gain their fortune by doing something new , something that no one else has ever done before ; their risk is doing something that nobody else knows how to do well .</t></pair><pair id="594" value=""><t>You stand nowhere on any subject .</t></pair><pair id="595" value=""><t>This way anyone can reach success in his or her lfe and career .</t></pair><pair id="596" value=""><t>There have been a lot of members that have gone to the surface of the moon and landed safely back on earth .</t></pair><pair id="597" value=""><t>Now let 's take the example of a millionaire who has n't managed to let go of his childish ways .</t></pair><pair id="598" value=""><t>Without facts , there will be no new ideas or concepts developed .</t></pair><pair id="599" value=""><t>For example , when I was a freshman at Meiji University in Japan , my classmates and I traveled to China .</t></pair><pair id="600" value=""><t>Some people dislike traveling in groups , having to follow strict time schedules , and following rules .</t></pair><pair id="601" value=""><t>In this case , older people can drink and can go to a lot of places such as night clubs , bars , and so on .</t></pair><pair id="602" value=""><t>A specialist in any field will have better job opportunities ; of course , he will not have as many opportunities , but whatever the opportunities , they will be far better .</t></pair><pair id="603" value=""><t>Second , many of the disadvantages of cars will decrease or even cease in the coming years , which will make them even more popular than at the current time .</t></pair><pair id="604" value=""><t>The same will happen to taxes on cars and gasoline .</t></pair><pair id="605" value=""><t>Today , drinking soda has become an addiction for many people .</t></pair><pair id="606" value=""><t>Thus , a number of people got together and asked the guide to change the schedule , and the guide could not help but to accept their requests .</t></pair><pair id="607" value=""><t>Hence , these advertisements may convince people that the brand being advertised is actually the best quality product , when in fact it is not .</t></pair><pair id="608" value=""><t>This economics system is the best .</t></pair><pair id="609" value=""><t>He pointed out that climate plays a role in the erosion of materials .</t></pair><pair id="610" value=""><t>If they are a family that likes to travel , they will prefer a car to other types of vehicles .</t></pair><pair id="611" value=""><t>If we have a job we like , we will love to do that job no matter how difficult .</t></pair><pair id="612" value=""><t>If you want to actually know someone , you should spend the whole day with that person , but if you do not , you should not even speak to that person .</t></pair><pair id="613" value=""><t>an 7unsuspection user cannto tell the entruy has vees tampered with .</t></pair><pair id="614" value=""><t>This can be prevented if a broad choice is given .</t></pair><pair id="615" value=""><t>Usually , I do n't want just myself in an unknown place .</t></pair><pair id="616" value=""><t>I think cars will not be completely replaced by new automobile innovations , but they will certainly be fewer in numbers .</t></pair><pair id="617" value=""><t>Now , I am a really happy girl because I found my confidence .</t></pair><pair id="618" value=""><t>Those advertisements make products seem a lot better than they really are .</t></pair><pair id="619" value=""><t>But in contrast , the professor states in the lecture that it is impossible for the video not to be expensive .</t></pair><pair id="620" value=""><t>And to do that we need to move .</t></pair><pair id="621" value=""><t>Does age actually have an impact on the way you live your own life ?</t></pair><pair id="622" value=""><t>Robots can work all day and no one gets tired .</t></pair><pair id="623" value=""><t>Eventually , some of them wanted to buy the product .</t></pair><pair id="624" value=""><t>Successful therapists need to know that one treatment can help one person but for another , it could be not appropriate .</t></pair><pair id="625" value=""><t>In today 's world , we have just developed the first aspect .</t></pair><pair id="626" value=""><t>I had a lot of problems studying science .</t></pair><pair id="627" value=""><t>It 's big importance is conscious with the bad consequences of it 's decline if people continue to prefer laying down at home watching bad tv programs and other ways of easy culture , maybe more attractive to them , but bad for our future .</t></pair><pair id="628" value=""><t>So we will be more successful on the day of the exam .</t></pair><pair id="629" value=""><t>The professor needs them to do a project .</t></pair><pair id="630" value=""><t>And when you order a Big Mac and see the size of it , it 's nothing compared to what you saw in the commercial and I feel like throwing it at their face .</t></pair><pair id="631" value=""><t>But I cannot use only my own subject to design a building .</t></pair><pair id="632" value=""><t>Life is never easy , and your age does n't determine whether you will be protected from or prevented from experiencing bad things .</t></pair><pair id="633" value=""><t>If not , we do not need to start the procedure .</t></pair><pair id="634" value=""><t>It 's called " ballast water " .</t></pair><pair id="635" value=""><t>If there are many people like me , then the fashion market will develop .</t></pair><pair id="636" value=""><t>The student must be capable of understanding ideas and concepts , and at the same time , knowing the way how they must be developed .</t></pair><pair id="637" value=""><t>We are also able to deal with any problems found with it .</t></pair><pair
